react-three-legacy
==================

For your React 3D needs this legacy package has been replaced by another package (react-three-fiber) which
has replaced the old react-three packages on npm. I strongly suggest you update your code to work with react-three-fiber.
If not, you can still use this library via github links or as the npm package ```react-three-legacy```

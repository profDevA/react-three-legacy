react-three-legacy
==================

Create/control a [three.js](http://threejs.org/) canvas using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

To use React for drawing 2D using WebGL, try [react-pixi](https://github.com/Izzimach/react-pixi).

This react-three is deprecated
==============================

For your React 3D needs this legacy package has been replaced by another package (react-three-fiber) which
has replaced the old react-three packages on npm. I strongly suggest you update your code to work with react-three-fiber.
If not, you can still use this library via github links or as the npm package ```react-three-legacy```
